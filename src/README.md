## Search Criteria

Search crieria is used for searching the mailbox for messages that match
the given searching criteria.  

Searching criteria consist of one or more search keys. When multiple keys are 
specified, the result is the intersection (AND function) of all the messages 
that match those keys.  

Example:

 **`DELETED FROM "SMITH" SINCE 1-Feb-1994`** refers 
to all deleted messages from Smith that were placed in the mailbox since 
February 1, 1994.  

A search key can also be a parenthesized list of one or more search keys 
(e.g., for use with the OR and NOT keys).

**`SINCE 10-Feb-2019`**  will search all messages that received since 10 Feb 2019

**`UID SEARCH ALL`**  will seach all message which will return the message UID 
that can be use later for fetch one or more messages.

 
The following keywords can be used for the search criteria.


**ALL** - All messages in the mailbox; the default initial key for	ANDing.

**ANSWERED** - Messages with the \Answered flag set.

**BCC** - Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope structure's BCC field.

**BEFORE** - Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone) is earlier than the specified date.

**BODY** - Messages that contain the specified string in the body of the message.

**CC** - Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope structure's CC field.

**DELETED** - Messages with the \Deleted flag set.

**DRAFT** - Messages with the \Draft flag set.

**FLAGGED** - Messages with the \Flagged flag set.

**FROM** - Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope	structure's FROM field.

**HEADER** - Messages that have a header with the specified field-name (as defined in [RFC-2822])

and that contains the specified string	in the text of the header (what comes after the colon).

If the string to search is zero-length, this matches all messages that have a header line with 

the specified field-name regardless of	the contents.

**KEYWORD** - Messages with the specified keyword flag set.

**LARGER** - Messages with an (RFC-2822) size larger than the specified number of octets.

**NEW** -  Messages that have the \Recent flag set but not the \Seen flag.

This is functionally equivalent to **"(RECENT UNSEEN)"**.

**NOT** - Messages that do not match the specified search key.

**OLD** - Messages that do not have the \Recent flag set.  This is	functionally equivalent to

**"NOT RECENT"** (as opposed to **"NOT NEW"**).

**ON** - Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone) is within the specified date.

**OR** - Messages that match either search key.

**RECENT** - Messages that have the \Recent flag set.

**SEEN** - Messages that have the \Seen flag set.

**SENTBEFORE** - Messages whose (RFC-2822) Date: header (disregarding time and	timezone) is earlier than the specified date.

**SENTON** - Messages whose (RFC-2822) Date: header (disregarding time and timezone) is within the specified date.

**SENTSINCE** - Messages whose (RFC-2822) Date: header (disregarding time and timezone) is within or later than the specified date.

**SINCE** - Messages whose internal date (disregarding time and timezone) is within or later than the specified date.

**SMALLER** - Messages with an (RFC-2822) size smaller than the specified number of octets.

**SUBJECT** - Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope structure's SUBJECT field.

**TEXT** - Messages that contain the specified string in the header or body of the message.

**TO** - Messages that contain the specified string in the envelope structure's TO field.

**UID** - Messages with unique identifiers corresponding to the specified unique identifier set.  

Sequence set ranges are permitted.

**UNANSWERED** - Messages that do not have the \Answered flag set.

**UNDELETED** - Messages that do not have the \Deleted flag set.

**UNDRAFT** - Messages that do not have the \Draft flag set.

**UNFLAGGED** - Messages that do not have the \Flagged flag set.

**UNKEYWORD** - Messages that do not have the specified keyword flag set.

**UNSEEN** - Messages that do not have the \Seen flag set.
