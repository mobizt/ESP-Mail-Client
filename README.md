## [Deprecated]

This library is now deprecared. The new library is already released.

The [ReadyMail](https://github.com/mobizt/ReadyMail), new, fast and lightweight async Email client library for Arduino is available. 

The new Email client library supports both async and await mode usages with simple APIs.

The new library interfaces are simple, no more config class and config file. The network interface and filesystem are independent which allows you to work with any network and filesystem.

With new IMAP parser, the library reliability has been improved while providing less program space (only 52k). Let's try.
